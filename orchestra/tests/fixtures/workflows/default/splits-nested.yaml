  A basic workflow that demonstrate splits that are nested. The
  following workflow will instantiate two separate branches at
  task4 and then splitting again at task7 resulting in four
  separate instances of task7.

tasks:
  task1:
    action: std.noop
    next:
      - when: <% task_state(task1) = "SUCCESS" %>
        do: task2, task3

  # branch 1
  task2:
    action: std.noop
    next:
      - when: <% task_state(task2) = "SUCCESS" %>
        do: task4

  # branch 2
  task3:
    action: std.noop
    next:
      - when: <% task_state(task3) = "SUCCESS" %>
        do: task4

  # split branch
  task4:
    action: std.noop
    next:
      - when: <% task_state(task4) = "SUCCESS" %>
        do: task5, task6
  task5:
    action: std.noop
    next:
      - when: <% task_state(task5) = "SUCCESS" %>
        do: task7
  task6:
    action: std.noop
    next:
      - when: <% task_state(task6) = "SUCCESS" %>
        do: task7

  # nested split
  task7:
    action: std.noop
    next:
      - when: <% task_state(task7) = "SUCCESS" %>
        do: task8, task9
  task8:
    action: std.noop
    next:
      - when: <% task_state(task8) = "SUCCESS" %>
        do: task10
  task9:
    action: std.noop
    next:
      - when: <% task_state(task9) = "SUCCESS" %>
        do: task10
  task10:
    join: all
    action: std.noop
