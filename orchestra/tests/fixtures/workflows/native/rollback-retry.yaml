  A sample workflow that demonstrates how to handle rollback and retry on error. In this example,
  the workflow will loop until the file /tmp/done exists. A parallel task will wait for some time
  before creating the file. When completed, /tmp/done will be deleted.

tasks:
  init:
    action: core.local cmd="rm -f /tmp/done"
    next:
      - when: <% succeeded() %>
        do: check, create

  check:
    action: core.local
    input:
      cmd: >
        echo 'Do something useful here.';
        if [ ! -e '/tmp/done' ]; then exit 1; fi
    next:
      - when: <% succeeded() %>
        do: delete
      - when: <% failed() %>
        do: rollback

  rollback:
    action: core.local
    input:
      cmd: >
        echo 'Rollback something here.';
        sleep 1;
    next:
      - when: <% succeeded() %>
        do: check

  create:
    action: core.local cmd="sleep 10; touch /tmp/done"

  delete:
    action: core.local cmd="rm -f /tmp/done"
